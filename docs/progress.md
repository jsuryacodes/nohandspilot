# Build log

Newest first. Each entry matches a commit on `main`.

## 28 Oct: Menu-bar app, Hands, both triggers
- `app/build.sh`: builds, runs BrainCheck, assembles `Pilot.app`, signs it with a fixed self-signed
  certificate ("Pilot Local Signing", own keychain) and installs to `~/Applications`. The signature
  requirement is `identifier dev.jsurya.pilot + certificate leaf`, so permissions survive rebuilds.
- Hands (`Hands.swift`): open/switch apps (waits until the app is in front), quit, shortcuts, typing
  (unicode events, works in Chrome's address bar), scroll (moves the pointer into the front window first).
- Trigger A (`Taps.swift`): session tap + frontmost-app tap catch Cmd+V sent by Wispr only, read the
  clipboard, swallow it if it's a Pilot command. Every Wispr paste is noted in `debug.log` with which
  tap saw it. Unmatched "Pilot …" text passes through untouched.
- Trigger B: Control+Option+P opens the command bar; dictated text runs by itself, typed text on Enter.
- HUD toast, "What can I say?" window, usage log (`~/Library/Application Support/Pilot/usage.jsonl`),
  today's count in the menu, Open at Login.
- Verified here: "open finder" from the terminal ran in 271 ms (match 1.9 ms). Not yet verified:
  anything needing Accessibility (keys, Wispr interception). That needs your test.

## 28 Oct: Brain + commands.json
- `commands/commands.json`: 44 commands (global, Chrome, Claude, VS Code, Finder), app aliases,
  synonyms, filler words, 2 macros. Claude shortcuts verified from Claude.app's own menu.
  One `TODO`: Chrome has no fixed sidebar shortcut.
- `app/Sources/PilotBrain/Brain.swift`: trigger stripping, chain splitting, exact command matching,
  fuzzy app names, per-app commands, "… in <app>", macros. Matching rules documented at the top
  (the web version must copy them).
- `app/Sources/BrainCheck`: 27 checks against the real JSON, including speed (~2.5 ms per chain,
  debug build). Run: `cd app && swift run BrainCheck`

## 28 Oct: Plan review
- `docs/plan-review.md`: risks, Wispr paste investigation, and the one change to a locked decision
  (Swift Package Manager instead of an Xcode project, because Xcode isn't installed).

## Next
- [ ] Your Wispr test (docs/setup.md) → fix whatever it shows
- [ ] `docs/setup.md`: permissions + the Wispr test you need to run
